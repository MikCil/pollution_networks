# Abstract
In ancient Greece, pollution (miasma, agos) signified a potent disruption, encompassing ritual
impurity, social transgression, and violations of fundamental boundaries (Meinel, 2015). While
extensively studied thematically, the dynamic spread of pollution through character interactions,
which may be considered its ‘ecology’ within the dramatic system, offers rich territory for
computational analysis. This proposal employs Network Analysis (Elson et al., 2010), applying it to
tragedies by Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, alongside select modern adaptations, as case
studies. Textual instances of pollution, categorised according to established scholarship (Parker, 1983;
Meinel, 2015; Petrovic & Petrovic, 2016), were mapped onto character co-occurrence networks. By
close reading main passages and analysing key word collocations, pollution was modelled as a
dynamic element within the networks. Through interactive visualisations and structural analysis,
contamination pathways were traced, identifying key vectors and points of vulnerability within the
social fabric of the plays. This ecological network approach aims to visualise the mechanics of
‘transformative pollution’ (Kesgin, 2022), demonstrating how contamination destabilises the
dramatic world, links individual actions to consequences for the polis, whose suffering often mirrors
blight upon the land itself, and shapes the disrupted futures depicted in tragedy. Ultimately, this
perspective proposes an underlying structural logic through which pollution operates, as individual
actions reverberate system-wide in an interconnected cosmos.
